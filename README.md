# WebEnv #

One click to setup web server environment base on your web 
application's environment. I just hate when I have my web application 
ready but the web service do not have all the thing I need to deploy 
my application. I would just want to run a script to setup all the 
environment I need to see my web application running. <br/><br/>

I am only one people writing this project, I would only update 
these script if I met the problem. If you think the idea is cool 
and will benefit others, feel free to make request or issue it.
